Hi I'm Duk, my real name is Duong Giap Duc but you can call me duck or duk is way easier to spell it. Currently I'm a new grad IT Student from Water Resource University Viet Nam. 

This is my personal blog for posting work about learning Unity and the progress taking the Google Certificate in Cybersecurity.

Wish all you wandering here have a nice day.
