+ Problem solving.

Technical skills: skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures, and policies.
+ Progamming languages.
+ Security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
+ Computer forensics.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information used to infer an individual's identity.

Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII): A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.

## Moduel 2

Social Engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

Phising: The use of digital communication to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
+ Business Email Compromise (BEC): send email from a known source to seem legitimate.
+ Spear phising: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users.
+ Whaling: a form of spear phising. target company excutives to gain access to sensitive data.
+ Vishing: the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
+ Smishing: used text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Malware is software designed to harm device or networks. There are many type of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some case, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.
+ Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause to data and software. from download file, etc.
+ Worms: malware that can duplicate and spread itselft.
+ Ransomware: encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
+ Spyware: gather and self information without consent. collect personal data,...

Social Engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It's the mision of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many ppl as possible.

+ Scarcity: fake an production.
+ Familiarity: exploite emotion.
+ Trust: like the above.
+ Urgency: Emergency fake.

8 domain define by CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional is a globally recognized and highly sought-after information security certification, awarded by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium 

+ Security and risk management: define security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
+ Asset security: secures digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
+ Security architecture and engineering: optimize data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
+ Communication and network security: Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.
+ Identity and access management: keep data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office space, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
+ Security assessment and testing: conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security auddits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
+ Security operations: conducting investigations and implementing preventative meansures.
+ Software development security: uses secure coding practices, which are set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
