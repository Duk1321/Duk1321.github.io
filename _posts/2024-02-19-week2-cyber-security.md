## Week 2

## Course 1 - Module 3

Security Frameworks and Control: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

Purpose of security frameworks
+ Protecting PII
  
+ Securing financial information
  
+ Identifying security weakness
  
+ Managing organization risks
  
+ Aligning security with business goals

Components of security frameworks

+ Identifying and documenting security goals

+ Setting guideline to achieve security goals
  
+ Implementing strong security processes
  
+ Monitoring and communicating results

CIA triad a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk 

when setting up systems and security policies.

It's stand for C - Confidentiality, I - Integrity, A - Availability.
+ Confidentiality: only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
  
+ Integrity mean data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
  
+ Availability mean data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

Asset an item perceived as having value to an organization

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) a voluntary framwork that consists 

of standards, guideline, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

Ethics of Security

Security ethics: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.

Ethical principles in security
+ Confidentiality
+ Law

# Course 3 - module 1
+ Structure of a network

+ Standard networking tools

+ Cloud networks

+ TCP/IP model

Network is a group of connected device.

Local Area Network (LAN) - a network that spans a small area like
an office building, a school, or a home.

Wide Area Network (WAN) - a network that spans a large geographic area like
a city, state, or country.

Hub - a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network

Switch - a device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and

receiving data between them.

Router - a netowrk device that connects multiple network together.

Modem - a device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN

Virtualization tools - pieces of software that perform network operations

Cloud computing - the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted

on the internet instead of on local physical devices

Bandwidth - the amount of data a device receices every second

Speed - the rate at which data packets are received or downloaded

Packet sniffing - the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - an internet communication protocol that allows

two devices to form a connection and stream data

Layer of TCP/IP model
+ Network access layer
+ Internet layer
+ Transport layer
+ Application Layer
